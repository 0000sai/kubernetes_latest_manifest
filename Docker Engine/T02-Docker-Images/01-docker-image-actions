How to pull image from specific repository?

For example:
- we have account created in Docker hub repository and pushed the image to our private repository.

- Lets clone the "ubuntu:20.04" image as "dubareddy/ubuntu:20.04" to push to our specific repository in docker hub.
Note: dubareddy is my docker hub account name which should be added a prefix

- Before pushing image to our repository, we need to login to the account from CLI and after that push the image by executing below command
#docker login --> enter username and password
#docker push dubareddy/ubuntu:20.04

- Login to docker hub dashboard and check if image is pushed.

- Cleanup the images which we have in local docker host to test
#docker image rm ubuntu:20.04 dubareddy/ubuntu:20.04

- Now pull the image from our private repository
#docker pull dubareddy/ubuntu:20.04
