# Docker containers
**Docker containers are created using images which has libraries, binaries etc., specific to that OS to run application**
- Docker containers are Thin layers which are created on top of image layers.
- Docker container image is a lightweight, standalone, executable package of software that includes everything needed to run an application: code, runtime, system tools, system libraries and settings.
- Any changes made inside the container are stored in container layer with COW strategy.
